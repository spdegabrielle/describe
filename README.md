## describe

Describe: Doug Williams's 'describe.plt' package from PLaneT.

Updated to Racket package catalog and modern Racket by Matthew Butterick

## Docs

https://docs.racket-lang.org/describe/

## Project status

This is a copy of [describe.plt](https://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=describe.plt&owner=williams) created by M. Doug Williams

Adjusted by Matthew Buttick so it works with Racket’s current package-server system and Racket CS (which after v8.0 is just “Racket”).

7 Feb 2025 

Moved to https://github.com/spdegabrielle/describe and licence changed 
to same terms as Racket copyright holders consent.

The licence can be changed as needed. I am mainly programming in Julia these days and preparing for retirement. :)

Hi Doug,

I hope you are well. 

Would you be willing to relicense the Describe library under the same terms as racket(copied).

The reason I am asking is we have discovered a number of packages have a dependency on it: 
https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/5179#issuecomment-2595710311

While you have moved on from Racket, but many of us remember your efforts and contributions to the community. 

I know you are busy, so I don’t want to waste your time:  simple reply is sufficient - I will pass on to the Racket team.  

Best wishes

Stephen

PS what are you into these days?
