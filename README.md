## Project status

Maintained, for some sense of that word. I didn’t write this code. This is a copy of a project that lives on Racket’s PLaneT servers, adjusted so it works with Racket’s current package-server system and Racket CS (which after v8.0 is just “Racket”). I don’t know how this code works and don’t even use this package anymore. But as long as it continues to demand almost nothing of me, I suppose I am maintaining it. But if there were a change to Racket that broke this package in a major way, I would let it die. No question.

The licence can be changed as needed. I am mainly programming in Julia these days and preparing for retirement. :)

Hi Doug,

I hope you are well. 

Would you be willing to relicense the Describe library under the same terms as racket(copied).

The reason I am asking is we have discovered a number of packages have a dependency on it: 
https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/5179#issuecomment-2595710311

While you have moved on from Racket, but many of us remember your efforts and contributions to the community. 

I know you are busy, so I don’t want to waste your time:  simple reply is sufficient - I will pass on to the Racket team.  

Best wishes

Stephen

PS what are you into these days?
